## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all contributors. Please be respectful, constructive, and collaborative in all discussions and interactions.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/HawkdotDev/repaper/issues) to verify if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Open a Detailed Issue**: If not, create a new issue using a descriptive title and include:

- Operating System and version (e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sequoia, Ubuntu 24.04).
- Repaper version or commit SHA.
- Clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Screenshots, screen recordings, or error logs from the Developer Tools console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are always welcome! When suggesting a feature:

- Explain **why** the feature is valuable and what problem it solves.
- Describe how you envision the user experience and interface working.
- Keep in mind Repaper's core principles: **local-first privacy**, **plain-text portability**, and **high performance**.

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements (fixing typos, clarifying setup instructions, adding code examples, or expanding guides) are great first-time contributions.

### Contributing Code

Ready to submit code? Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` to get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: `&gt;= 20.0.0`
- **Package Manager**: `npm`, `bun`, or `pnpm`
- **Git**: `&gt;= 2.30`

### Local Installation

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub: [https://github.com/HawkdotDev/repaper](https://github.com/HawkdotDev/repaper)
2. **Clone your fork**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/repaper.git
   cd repaper
```

1. **Add upstream remote**:

```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/HawkdotDev/repaper.git
```

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
   npm install
```

### Running in Development

Start the Electron + Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Architecture

Repaper is structured as a modern, high-performance web application using standard Vite:

```
repaper/
├── index.html                  # Root HTML shell
├── vite.config.ts              # Vite configuration (React, Tailwind CSS 4)
├── resources/                  # Branding assets and screenshots
├── src/
│   └── renderer/
│       └── src/                # React 19 Client Application
│           ├── assets/         # CSS tokens, base styles, branding assets
│           ├── components/     # UI components (Editor, Graph, Sidebar, Modals, Widgets)
│           ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks & state persistence
│           ├── services/       # WebFileSystem (IndexedDB/FSA) and WebWindow services
│           ├── types/          # Shared TypeScript type definitions
│           ├── utils/          # Markdown/Frontmatter parser, wikilink extractor, path utils
│           └── workers/        # Dedicated web workers (graph parsing, async indexing)
```

- **WebFileSystem (`src/renderer/src/services/webFileSystem.ts`)**: Manages persistent client storage in IndexedDB (`oink_storage`) and integrates the Web File System Access API for local directories.
- **WebWindow (`src/renderer/src/services/webWindow.ts`)**: Provides browser-native window and full-screen controls.
- **Client App (`src/renderer/src`)**: Modern React 19 application managing UI components, state, block editing, and graph visualization.

## Coding Standards &amp; Conventions

### TypeScript &amp; Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript everywhere. Avoid `any` types wherever possible.
- Run typechecks across all build targets before committing:

```bash
  npm run typecheck
```

_(Runs both `npm run typecheck:node` and `npm run typecheck:web`)_

### Linting &amp; Formatting

- Maintain code style by running ESLint and Prettier:

```bash
  # Check for lint issues
  npm run lint

  # Automatically fix lint issues
  npm run lint:fix

  # Format all files
  npm run format

  # Verify formatting without modifying files
  npm run format:check
```

### Styling &amp; UI Aesthetics

- Repaper uses a modern Brutalist dark-mode design system with Tailwind CSS 4 and scoped CSS variables.
- Keep UI responsive, clean, and accessible. Use Lucide icons (`lucide-react`) for UI iconography.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary heavy external dependencies.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Common Types

- `feat`: A new feature or capability
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes only
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, whitespace, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Build tasks, dependency updates, configuration changes

### Examples

- `feat(graph): add physics dampening toggle for large node graphs`
- `fix(editor): resolve markdown frontmatter serialization glitch`
- `docs: update setup instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create a descriptive branch**:

```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
```

1. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly locally.
2. **Validate code quality**:

```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
```

1. **Commit your changes**:

```bash
   git commit -m "feat(editor): add new inline callout block"
```

1. **Push to your fork**:

```bash
   git push origin feat/my-new-feature
```

1. **Submit a Pull Request** targeting the `main` branch of `HawkdotDev/repaper`.
2. **Fill out the PR description** detailing what changes were made, why, and any screenshots or testing verification steps.

## Building &amp; Packaging

To verify that desktop packaging succeeds on your machine:

```bash
# Package directory without creating installer (fast verification)
npm run build:unpack

# Build Windows installer (.exe)
npm run build:win

# Build macOS package (.dmg / .zip)
npm run build:mac

# Build Linux package (.AppImage / .deb)
npm run build:linux
```

All compiled binaries will be output to the `dist/` directory.
